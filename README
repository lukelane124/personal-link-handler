***************************** Personal Link Handler ****************************
=============== Goals ===============
Design a system that can take a shortened URL link and produce some operational 
output on the system.
An example might be: "tll://open?operation=1024j" could open a browser in a new
in a new tab and open someone's JIRA dashboard.

Another example: "tll://note?title=new-note-example&editor=vim" might open a new
note with a specific title in vim, if it's available. 

=========== Design Ideas ============
~litestream~
Using litestream and AWS S3 for my "backend" database backup solution.

~platform code~
Several options. Currently using Python3 as the backend application. 
Would seriously consider using Lua with a C-runtime implementation for the 
network stack and a sqlite3 import.


@@@@@@@@@@ Investigate @@@@@@@@@@
What does the overhead of using Lua give in return?
